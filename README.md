# Entropic-Elixirs
by Rachel Ginsberg

### about the project
Entropic Elixirs is a thought experiment designed to encourage people to think differently about their relationships with themselves, and the world around them. Specifically, the project asks audience members to consider how they might focus their own energy and intention around questions of personal growth and self work. 

Entropic Elixirs builds on the contemporary language of wellness to address the notion that it might one day be possible to influence and/or manage our bodies’ energetic activity with something that behaves much like the vitamin, mineral, and herbal supplements so many of us consume today. This Quantified Self companion installation will function more or less as a vending machine that dispenses bespoke liquid formulations designed to help users manage and direct their energies into personal growth directions that the system recommends to them. The installation will consist of two parts - an interactive assessment tool that assesses the state of the user’s energetic needs and suggests the correct formula, and a machine that will assemble and dispense that formula in the form of a liquid “shot,” to be consumed on site.
